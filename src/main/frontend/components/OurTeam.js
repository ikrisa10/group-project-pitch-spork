                    Hi, my name is Ilya! I'm passionate about the coding and about the music. I've been playing in bands here and there for about 10 years and learning coding about 1 year, which was a perfect mix for this start up!

                    I'm Kara, I'm a junior-junior level softdev who loves all kinds of music. I'll listen to anything but love progressive and alternative metal, much like how I will learn to code anything but prefer front-end.
